So today I intended to give my legs and feet a break so I stayed a but closer to home. Had more Varenyky at Katyusha Varenychna and then returned to Mariinsky Park for that view I missed to the fog on Tuesday.

Next I went to park located diagonally across the big intersection near my apartment. It has an impressive monument and a view that outshines the already impressive one from Mariinsky Park. From there I continued south to the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra. A monestary originally built around some caves in 1051.

Though I did not go into the caves or any building other than the church, the place was truly impressive and I ended up walking much more than intended. To be honest I'm not sure how I feel about visiting and wandering around a church with the sole purpose of gawking. Though it is unmistakable that a place like that was built for gawking, it seems wrong to visit with more interest in the building than otherwise.

On the way back I decided that even though I love Katyusha's I didn't want to walk that far. So I decided to try out the small food court beneath the nearby intersection. I got 2 "French hot dogs" and Fanta orange soda a bit later.

All in all a good day. But considering my current backache and sore feet I may have to stay in the next day or two.
