Not much happening today. Had lunch at Katyusha's, varenyky and borsht. Then I returned to the Park of Eternal Glory (the one with the obelisk) to enjoy the view for a while. Though I really wanted to do more, I decided to go to Silpo for more water and tissues, then back to the apartment to rest and figure out laundry.

For dinner, I took advantage of the fact that I am in a major modern city: I ordered food using Uber Eats.
