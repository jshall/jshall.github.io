Today was mostly people watching. Though my feet are not yet crying for mercy I decided not to push things today. I went to take a closer look at the Globus mall beneath Independence Square and do some people watching in the food court while enjoying an Oreo latte.

For dinner I thought I would see what passes for a pizza in Kyiv.
