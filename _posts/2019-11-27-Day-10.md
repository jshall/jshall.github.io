Today I kept things simple in deference to my feet. Lunch at Katyusha's and returned to the Park of Eternal Glory for pics and to enjoy the foggy view. In case you are wondering I have found that I really don't mind the chill. In fact on some days that chill was a nice counter to me overheating from the unfamiliar exertions of so much walking.

Sadly I think this is the end of my explorations. Tomorrow I will have to focus on repacking and making sure everything else is ready for my day of return travel starting around 4 AM on Friday. I may get out tomorrow, but I doubt you'll hear from me again before I get home.
