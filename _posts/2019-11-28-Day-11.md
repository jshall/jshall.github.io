After repacking and making sure everything is ready for my departure at 3 AM tomorrow, I had some time for a bit of a walk. So, I decided to revisit Mariinsky Park and to my delight found that I could more easily approach the palace today and that there was a good bit more to the park than I was aware of. I also found a much better observation point in the park, but sadly it was to foggy today to see anything.

All in all it has been a wonderful visit, but I am eager to return home, though not so eager to spend 26 hours in cars, airports and planes.
