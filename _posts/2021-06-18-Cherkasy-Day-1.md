I have been traveling for 25 hours, 32 if you count the bonus from timezones, but I am here at last! I cannot manage to really sleep on a plane, and in the airport it seems dangerous to try so despite my interest to see the countryside I did dose a little during the 2 hour car ride from the airport to my hotel in Cherkasy. And so after a few messages I got a few hours of sleep. Then on waking up I finally unpacked.

During the ride through the countryside it occurred to me that though I may be in Ukraine I have not escaped corn fields. It is actually quite a comfort to see that while there may be a different culture, language and even alphabet in this place there is still a great deal that is familiar.
